These folders contain the competitive programming problems I solved throughout the duration of this project.
Each file have solution to mentioned problem and first line of the solution have link of the problem as a comment.

I’m currently halfway through reading The Competitive Programmer’s Handbook by Antti Laaksonen, and it’s been a great resource for CP.

Plan given by the mentor :

Week 1: Arrays, Time Complexity, Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sorting

Week 2: Strings, Pattern Matching, Recursion, Number Theory (GCD, Sieve, Modular Arithmetic)

Week 3: Linked Lists, OOP (Classes, Inheritance), Pointers and Memory Concepts

Week 4: Stacks, Queues, Deques, Expression Evaluation, Backtracking

Week 5: Binary Trees, Tree Traversals, Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, Computational Geometry

Week 6: Graph Representations, BFS, DFS, Connected Components

Week 7: Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Kosaraju’s, 1D Dynamic Programming

Week 8: 2D Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LCS), String Algorithms (KMP, Z-Algorithm, Tries)

This is the the repo for the full project, so I will be updating it everyday.
